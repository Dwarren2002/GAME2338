Summary
The game isn’t complete and thus I was about to finish what the game currently has. The description of the game is you play as a coyote and are solving puzzles to find lost villagers and then can interact with them. 


Final Thoughts
I like what the game has so far as it is only a tech demo. The reason I am giving it 3 stars is that I had no idea what to do what I was meant to be doing without having to explore the site. I like being able to jump into a game but I need to be able to know whats going on and what is expected of me in the game. I love the art, the detail in the gameplay is very well done and thought out. The only real issue play wise is I had a lot of trouble “accessing” thing I picked up from my inventory.
