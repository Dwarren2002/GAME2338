Summary
This game is a cooking game. You collect orders, make them and then serv them and the cusmoers rate you on how long they waited, how you did on the subsections of making the cupcake and then you see how many paoints you got and what they tipped you. After eveyday you get tickets from your customer and you can play a mini-game and win prizes. You can decorate your store or you character as well for perks.
Final Thoughts
I liked it for what it was. You can tell it's a little older and some of the mechanics are odd and a little difficult for a kids game, pouring the frosting on the cupcake. Overall it's a good kids game and I can see why kids play it when they are board on school computers. I will say I do thing that for this game the mechanics are a little difficult and the tutorial is blocky and got in my way while I was trying to work.
